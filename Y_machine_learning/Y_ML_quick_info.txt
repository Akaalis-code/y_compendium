AI AGENT = an "AI MODEL" + Ability to be aware of its environment and learn how to react as need 
    Example :   suppose you want to know and summarize and prioritize the world news as of today ,
                it should have an AI mdel which has ability for interaction like LLM and on top of that
                Some WEBSCRAPER to have the ability to study its environment.
