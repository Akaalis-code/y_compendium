There was a king who has a treasure Vault 
He has two sons to whom the treasure vault will be inherited to after the king

The king wanted treasure vault to be secured by a pass phrase .
So out of complete random thought he typed a random binary sequence of 1s and 0s of length 100


So the password would be some thing like this 

1011001001111..........001  ---->> of 100 digits length


p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 .... p100 where pn contains either (1 or 0)



king divided the password among two sons in this way ,
All the odd place values he told to son 1 and even place values to son 2 and no one else has any info
regarding this password other than these three.



one day the king and son1 had an accident and dies .


now Son2 wants to open the vault .

But he only has half of the pass key 
that is p2 p4 p6 ....p2n....p100


he is missing the p1 p3 p5 ....p2N+1..... P99



After discussing with the ministers he came to know king had setup up the vault in such a way that 
it opens even if password matches atleast 90 percent of the actual passcode.


So if you were the son2 , what would you do ?






In actuality the info that we dont know is actualy lost forever , no one knows what those odd positions
hold.




Tell me in comments what would you do in tis case.



So comming to son2 , what he has done is 

He took a survey ....

The survey goes like this 


He will go to all the allies and friends of the king one by one and asks 
"you have known the king for a lot of years , So based on what you know of kings mindset ,
if you were to guess what the 100 digit pass code would be what would it be?"


So he gathers awnsers from all the friends .

Now which fiends awnser should he rely on more ? 
How will you decide that ?

There is a way 

You Compare the even parts of the password you have with their awnsers ,

Whose so ever awnser matches more you would rely on them more .

But awnsers from randomness could only match to certain extent for all the friends ...

and if any  two or more friends awnsers match to an same percentage with your even Password 
what will you do then ?
