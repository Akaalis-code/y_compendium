# Intro :
    Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform for high-performance 
    data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications

    In the world of DATA BASES  -   we had attributes sorrounded around THINGS
                                    That is, "what is that thing" ,leaving less emphasis on the thing's changing nature 
                                    as time proceeds 
    In the world Today          -   We have attributes sourounded by EVENTS (Time based)
                                    That is "At a particular time what is that Thing" , Having more EMPHASIS on the thing's
                                    changing nature as time proceeds
    
    Kafka has "EVENTS first" approach rather than "THINGs first" approach

    Previous to kafka there were "ACTIVE MQ" , "RABBIT MQ" , "IBM MQ" which were being use as messaging queue technologies

    KAFKA s Cloud solutions are as below :
        Azure Event Hubs
