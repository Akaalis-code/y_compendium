# Checking how different tables behave :
    1) Create a normal table with some schema and insert couple of rows manually :
        1.1) Check what the table`s type is comming up in META DATA
        1.2) Check the actual location of the data stored and if possible where the table definition is stored
        1.3) Delete the table and see if only table definition is deleting or the data too

    2) Create a table By using the data that is actually present in external storage :
        2.1) Check what the table`s type is comming up in META DATA
        2.2) Check the actual location of the data stored and if possible where the table definition is stored
        2.3) Delete the table and see if only table definition is deleting or the data too
