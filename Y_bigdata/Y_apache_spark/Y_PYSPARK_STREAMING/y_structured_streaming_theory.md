# Structured streaming :

    Problem statement :-
        While spark sql is there to process BATCH(data size is bound and expected to stay that way) data ,
        There is a need of technology which is capable of working with a "UNBOUND CONTINOUSLY GROWING"
        data sources , in short that kind of data is called STREAMING data.
        That is where STRUCTURED STREAMING comes into picture
    
    How is this different from "SPARK STREAMING" :-
        STRUCTURED STREAMING(Uses dataframe and datasets API s) is advanced version of SPARK STREAMING(Dstream API)
        STRUCTURED STREAMING has been added with many advanced features compared to SPARK STREAMING
        Those details we will see below
