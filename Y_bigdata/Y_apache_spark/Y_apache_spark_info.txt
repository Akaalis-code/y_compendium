1) SPARK is relacement of MAP REDUCE in hadoop echo system
2) SPARK is faster than MAP REDUCE because , SPARK does "COMPLETE" in memory computation unlike 
   MAP REDUCE where even though it too uses memory to do computation , there might be times where some intermediate data gets 
   moved back and forth between memory and storage 
   that movement back and forth is what makes MAP REDUCE slow.
