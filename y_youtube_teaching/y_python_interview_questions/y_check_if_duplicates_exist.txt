In a list of values just find out if the list of lentgth 20 numbers 
where a list of first 20 values have been randomly placed
have any duplicates or not .

Bad logic :
    Compare each value with its subsequent value.
    Complexity = O(n(n+1)/2)

Good logic :
    Just check if the sum of values in list is equal to sum of first N integers value 
    Complexity = O(n)
