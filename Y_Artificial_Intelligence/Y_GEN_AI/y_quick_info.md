Terminology :
    Tokenization : Dividing a much complex item in simpler possible item according to the necessity
        character tokenizer : 
            "the cat sat on the mat" -->> 
            ["T", "h", "e", " ", "c", "a", "t", " ", "s", "a", "t", " ", "o", "n", " ", "t", "h", "e", " ", "m", "a", "t", "."]
        subword tokenizer :
            "unbelievable"
            ["un", "believe", "able"]
        Word tokenizer :
            
        sentence tokenizer

    Embedding :
        Word embeddings Examples :
            Word2Vec
