Machine learning algorithms :

    Supervised learning :
        Regression :
            Linear regression 
            Logistic regression
        Classification :
            Decision tree
            Random forest : (Classification and regression)
                Combining many Decision trees together (Ensemble algorithm) will result random forest
                Bagging and Bootstrapping (Check later )
            Support vector machine
            K nearest neighbour (Can be regression or classification) :
                K is hyper parameter
                k=1 (overfitting)
                k= higher number (moving towards under fitting)
            Naive bayes

    Unsupervised learning :
        K means clustering :
            K is hyper parameter
        Heirarichal clustering
        DB scan
        Principal component analysis
        Guassian mix model
        Hidden markov process

    Reinforcement learning :
        Q learning
        Temporal learning
        Generative adversarial Networks
